You all know the wild grief that besets us when we remember
times of happiness. How far beyond recall they are, and
we are severed from them by something more pitiless than
leagues and miles. In the afterlight, too, the images stand
out more enticing than before; we think of them as we do
of the body of a dead loved one who rests deep in the earth,
and who now in his enhanced and spiritual splendour is like
a mirage of the desert before which we must tremble. And
constantly in our thirst-haunted dreams we grope for the
past in its every detail, in its every line and fold. Then
it cannot but seem to us as if we had not had our fill of
love and life; yet no regret brings back what has been let
slip. Would that this mood might be a lesson to us for
each moment of our happiness.
Sweeter still becomes the memory of our years by moon
and sun when their end has been in the abyss of fear.Only
then do we realise that for us mortals even this is great
good-fortune-to live our lives in our little communities
under a peaceful roof, with pleasing discourse and with
loving greeting at morning and at night. Alas ! always too
late do we grasp that, if it offered no more than this, our
horn of plenty brimmed with riches.s
